## Motivation
This project was initiated for a Data Science I school assignment, in which we were to apply data science fundamentals to solve and analyze any problem of our choosing.

The virus that started as an extension of Spring break has become a lot more than that. We want to see how people have felt, in terms of sentiment, about the pandemic and the many effects of it. Therefore, we decided to see if we could solve this as our assignment. We want to be able to assess sentiment towards the virus based off of short blurbs (in this case, Tweets) in order to create the ability to gauge the publicâ€™s opinions on the state of the pandemic. Along the way, we'll make interesting analysis about sentiment as events have progressed over time.
